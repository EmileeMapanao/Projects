# Projects
Program that finds all vampire numbers from 100,000 to 999,999
There are two child threads, one thread checks all even numbers
for vampires, the other checks all odd numbers. Each thread will
print when a new vampire is found and give their respective fangs.
Once these threads are complete, main threads prints total
number of vampires found.
